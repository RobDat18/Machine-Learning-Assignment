## Johns Hopkins University - Coursera Practical Machine Learning course
### Final assignment by RobDat18, March 2019

The assigment's RMD and HTML files are available in this Github directory, in "a gh-pages branch so the HTML page can be viewed online", 
as suggested in the assignment text.
Unfortunately, the HTML file is still not readable in a compiled version (despite several hours of increasingly frustrating efforts, sorry :-)).  
You are therefore kindly requested to review the compiled version on the [RPubs site](http://rpubs.com/RobDat18/475902).
Your understanding and cooperation is very much appreciated.  
(RPubs was previously used during this Data Science specialization to share assignment results, so it seems a reasonable alternative)
